# Multilingual Formality Evaluation: Meaning Evaluation aspect

For automatic evaluation of meaning preservation between an informal text (system input) and a formal text (system output)
we suggest using the chrF score of Maja PopoviÄ‡ (detailed description is found in the
[chrF: character n-gram F-score for automatic MT evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/W15-3049/);
official implementation is [here](https://github.com/m-popovic/chrF)).

    abstract = "While the field of style transfer (ST) has been growing rapidly, it has been hampered by a lack of standardized practices for automatic evaluation. In this paper, we evaluate leading automatic metrics on the oft-researched task of formality style transfer. Unlike previous evaluations, which focus solely on English, we expand our focus to Brazilian-Portuguese, French, and Italian, making this work the first multilingual evaluation of metrics in ST. We outline best practices for automatic evaluation in (formality) style transfer and identify several models that correlate well with human judgments and are robust across languages. We hope that this work will help accelerate development in ST, where human evaluation is often challenging to collect.",
