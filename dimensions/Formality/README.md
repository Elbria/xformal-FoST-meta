# Formality Regressors for Multilingual Formality Evaluation

This repository describes how to obtain formality regressors for multilingual automatic evaluation of Formality Style
Transfer (FoST).

The evaluation is based on a *single* model that fine-tunes XLM-R [1](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.747.pdf)
on English formality ratings [2](https://aclanthology.org/Q16-1005/). Evaluation on languages other than
English is performed in a zero-shot setting.

The above implementation is based on [Huggingface Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

## Setup

    cd transformers/
    pip install -e .
    cd ..

## Training Formality Regressor

    bash train.sh

## Evaluate Formality Regressor

    bash inference_formality.sh

In this paper, we evaluate leading automatic metrics on the oft-researched task of formality style transfer. Unlike previous evaluations, which focus solely on English, we expand our focus to Brazilian-Portuguese, French, and Italian, making this work the first multilingual evaluation of metrics in ST. We outline best practices for automatic evaluation in (formality) style transfer and identify several models that correlate well with human judgments and are robust across languages. We hope that this work will help accelerate development in ST, where human evaluation is often challenging to collect.",

We also discuss challenges of using automatic metrics.",

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6{\%} average accuracy on XNLI, +13{\%} average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4{\%} F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7{\%} in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4{\%} for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code and models publicly available.",
